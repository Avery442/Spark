## Using "Spectate Me" on two 2 PCs

### You will need:

- One PCs capable of running EchoVR on the same network
- Spark installed on both PCs
- API enabled in the game settings on both PCs
  - You can use Spark to enable the API setting

### Setup

1. On your playing PC (the one with your headset):
   1. Launch the game normally and join a private/public match or lobby
   2. Launch Spark
   3. The IP Address in Spark should be set to 127.0.0.1 (or click the Local PC button)
   

2. On your Spectating PC:
   1. Open Spark
   2. Click "Settings"
   3. Put your playing PC's local IP address in the area for Quest IP.
   4. Change the port to 6724
   5. If the playing PC is in a match/lobby and has Spark running, then Spark should say "Connected" at this point.
   6. Click "Spectate Me"
   
If all is well, then your spectator will follow you into pubs and privates.
